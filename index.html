    <h1><u>Maneskin</u></h1>
  
    <p>
    Måneskin (Danish: [ˈmɔːnəˌske̝nˀ];[1] Danish for 'moonlight') are an Italian rock band formed in Rome in 2016. The band is composed of vocalist Damiano David, bassist Victoria De Angelis, guitarist Thomas Raggi, and drummer Ethan Torchio.[2] Performing in the streets in their early days, they rose to prominence after finishing second in the eleventh season of the Italian talent show X Factor in 2017. Their international breakthrough ensued when the foursome won the Eurovision Song Contest 2021 for Italy with the song "Zitti e buoni".

    The band have released two studio albums, entitled Il ballo della vita (2018) and Teatro d'ira: Vol. I (2021). They have also released one extended-play and ten singles, which have topped the Italian and European music charts. They have collected 34 platinum and 7 gold certifications from FIMI,[3] and have sold over one million records in Italy before their post-Eurovision breakthrough.[4] Up to that point in their career, their most successful Italian single was "Torna a casa". In 2021, Måneskin became the first Italian rock band to reach the top 10 on the UK Singles Chart, with their songs "Zitti e buoni", "I Wanna Be Your Slave" and their cover of The Four Seasons' "Beggin'" reaching the top 10 on the Billboard Global Excl. U.S. chart, collecting multiple international certifications for sales of over three million copies internationally, and four million in total.</p>
   <h3> Musical style and influences</h3>
<p>According to Damiano David, the group is "a translation of the music of the past into modernity".[84] Måneskin's music has been classified as pop rock,[2][85] alternative rock,[86] glam rock,[87] and hard rock.[88] Their music style changed from a pop rock sound with funk influences in their first studio album,[89] to hard rock in their second studio album, as seen in "Zitti e buoni".[90][91] Their look and sound have been compared to 70s rock music.[44] The band members have cited various musical and fashion influences, including, Led Zeppelin, Fleetwood Mac, Nirvana, Radiohead,[32] Franz Ferdinand,[92] David Bowie, Aerosmith, Black Sabbath,[93] Gentle Giant,[94] The Rolling Stones, The Doors,[84] Arctic Monkeys,[95] Red Hot Chili Peppers, Harry Styles, Bruno Mars,[26] R.E.M. and Italian rock bands Marlene Kuntz, Verdena and Afterhours.
