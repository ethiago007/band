   <p> As the winners of the Sanremo Music Festival 2021, Måneskin were designated as the Italian representatives at the Eurovision Song Contest 2021, held in Rotterdam, Netherlands, with "Zitti e buoni". Arriving as main favorites to win, on 22 May the band confirmed the predictions by going on to win the contest with an energetic performance, having received a total of 524 points, thus giving Italy its third Eurovision triumph after Gigliola Cinquetti in 1964 and Toto Cutugno in 1990. Måneskin also became the first band and "Zitti e buoni" the first rock song to win the contest since Lordi with "Hard Rock Hallelujah" for Finland in 2006. Upon accepting the winner's trophy, Damiano shouted into the microphone:
          We just want to say to the whole of Europe, to the whole world, rock and roll never dies!</div>
        
      <div class="col-3">  After the contest, the album Teatro d'ira Vol. I, its single "Zitti e buoni", tracks "I Wanna Be Your Slave" and "Coraline" as well as other releases from the band entered weekly charts across Europe and beyond, including several Spotify global charts. "Zitti e buoni" and "I Wanna Be Your Slave" also entered the top ten of the Billboard Global Excl. U.S. chart. "Zitti e buoni" also became the first Italian song in 30 years to chart on the top 20 of the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 17, as well as "I Wanna Be Your Slave" peaking at number five, which was the first song by an Italian band to reach the UK top ten, thus making the band the first Eurovision winners since Celine Dion to have two songs in the UK top 40, and a top 10 hit with a non-contest song. Their 2017 cover of "Beggin'" also peaked at number six, thus making them the first Italian act and the first Eurovision-associated act to have two songs charting in the top ten of the UK Singles Chart at the same time. "Beggin'" later debuted on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart at number 78 and went on to peak at number 13, making them the second Eurovision-winning act in recent history to break into the chart. "I Wanna Be Your Slave" and "Beggin'" were subsequently certified gold by the BPI, with the former also certified gold and the latter platinum by the RIAA.</div>
